# Hi, I'm Cadisha

## Bioinformatics & Data Engineer — Spatial Omics & Imaging (Health)

I design **production-ready data pipelines** for spatial transcriptomics, biomedical imaging and health data, with a strong focus on **reproducibility, scalability and real-world industry use cases**.

* Background in bioinformatics platform engineering  
* Spatial transcriptomics (Visium, Xenium, Visium HD)  
* Biomedical & microscopy image analysis  
* Data engineering & pipeline orchestration  
* Based in Paris — open to EU / international remote roles

## What I Do

I work at the intersection of **biology, data engineering and software**, turning complex biological data into **reliable, reusable and production-grade pipelines**.

Typical problems I solve:
- Industrializing spatial transcriptomics analyses
- Integrating imaging and omics data (multi-modal)
- Designing ETL pipelines for health and biological data
- Ensuring reproducibility, traceability and data quality
- Bridging the gap between research and production
